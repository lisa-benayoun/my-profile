	 <h2> Music 🎶 </h2>
	 <p>
		I've always loved music and started playing the piano when I was 8 years old. I also listen to a lot of music all the time, and love discovering new artists and genres.
		My favourite artists and bands are Oasis, David Bowie, Amy Winehouse, Kendrick Lamar and Lauryn Hill.

	 <h2> Cinema 🎬 </h2>
	 <p>
		I started to get really into cinema when I was entered highschool, around the age of 14, and have watched a lot of movies since then...
		Today, my favourite movies are Cinema Paradiso and Lost in translation.

	 <h2> Future 🔮</h2>
	 <p>
		I would really like there to be a creative dimension in my job later on, and would especially like my work to have some meaning to me and to the world. That is why I would like to work in Sustainable Marketing, and promote circular economies so as to help limit companies' impacts on the planet.🌍
